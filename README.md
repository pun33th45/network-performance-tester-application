# 🚀 iPerf GUI Performance Tool

A **desktop-based graphical extension** of the **iPerf Web Performance Tool**, developed as part of my **Network Engineering Internship**.  
This application provides a **real-time GUI wrapper over iPerf3** to perform practical TCP/UDP network performance testing with live visualization.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The iPerf GUI Performance Tool abstracts complex CLI-based network testing into a **simple, interactive desktop interface**.  
It enables engineers to configure tests, execute real backend commands, and analyze performance metrics visually.

> ⚠️ This is **not a demo or simulated project**.  
> All metrics are generated from **actual iPerf3 backend execution**.

## 🧑‍💻 Internship Context

- **Domain:** Network Engineering  
- **Base Tool:** iPerf3  
- **Project Type:** Internship / Industry-oriented project  
- **Purpose:** Practical network performance analysis using a GUI-based approach
